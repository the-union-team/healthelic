# HealthElic Landing Page - What We Built

We created a beautiful, responsive landing page for HealthElic that introduces their intelligent clinical copilots with a modern navbar featuring rich dropdown menus and smooth hover effects.

The hero section tells HealthElic's story with gradient text highlighting "smarter, more human" and "intelligent clinical copilots," accompanied by a friendly 3D character that brings the brand to life.

Everything is built with reusable components following best practices - buttons, navigation links, and dropdowns all share consistent styling and smooth interactions that feel polished and professional.

The entire design is fully responsive, looking great on everything from phones to large desktop screens, with carefully tuned font sizes and spacing that adapt perfectly to each device.

Behind the scenes, we used a DRY approach with centralized JSON configuration and clean component architecture, making it easy to update navigation items or add new features without touching multiple files.
